# Hit-Block-Charge
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
## Description:
It is a modded version of my childhood game I played in primary school. I am not really sure how can I translate the game name to english and make it sound good so just stick with Hit Block Charge for now. The game is super simple the player have 1 life and could do these 3 actions Charge, Block, and Attack(require at least 1 charge) because the game is super easy to get into there is a lots of add on from the player so the game is very diverse. That all for the background.
My version is very close to the original but in a theme of cybersecurity display by using ascii art.
This was my funny idea give to the group work in class but my friend drop it so I make it as fun project for CS50p
How you like it!
